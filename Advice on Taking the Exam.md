The CISSP exam consists of two key elements. First, you need to know the material from the eight domains. Second, you must have good test-taking skills. You have a maximum of 3 hours to achieve a passing standard with the potential to see up to 150 questions. Thus, you will have on average just over a minute for each question, so it is important to work quickly, without rushing, but also without wasting time.

Question skipping is not allowed on the CISSP CAT exam. You cannot return to view or change a previous question, and you're also not allowed to jump around, so one way or another, you have to come up with your best answer on each question as it is presented to you. If you don't know how to answer a question, then we recommend that you attempt to eliminate as many answer options as possible before making a guess. Then you can make educated guesses from a reduced set of options to increase your chance of getting a question correct. Since you have to answer every question presented, and you might not know the answer to some questions, you should develop a guessing strategy to select an answer promptly to minimize further wasting time.

Also note that ISC2 does not disclose if there is partial credit given for multiple-part questions if you get only some of the elements correct. So, pay attention to questions with checkboxes, and be sure to select as many items as necessary to properly address the question.

You will be provided with a dry-erase board and a marker to jot down thoughts and make notes. But nothing written on that board will be used to alter your score. That board must be returned to the test administrator prior to departing the test facility.

To maximize your test-taking activities, here are some general guidelines:

- Read each question carefully, then read the answer options, and then reread the question.
- Eliminate wrong answers before selecting the correct one.
- Watch for double negatives.
- Pay attention to universal terms, such as always or never.
- Look for relationships between answer options, such as similes, antonyms, sets, groups, parent/child, category/example, etc.
- Be sure you understand what the question is asking.

Manage your time. You can take breaks during your test, but this will consume some of your test time. You might consider bringing a drink and snacks, but your food and drink will be stored for you away from the testing area, and that break time will count against your test time limit. Be sure to bring any medications or other essential items, but leave all things electronic at home or in your car. You should avoid wearing anything on your wrists, including watches, fitness trackers, and jewelry. You are not allowed to bring any form of noise-canceling headsets or earbuds, although you can use foam earplugs. We also recommend wearing comfortable clothes and taking a light jacket with you (some testing locations are a bit chilly).
